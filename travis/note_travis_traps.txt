Setting yml as following won't work
os:
  - osx
python:
  - 3.6

Because 'language: python' is an error on Travis CI macOS


env:
  global:
    - VAR1=1
env:
  - VAR2=2

The global won't work. env will be overwritten.


Using travis CI linux to deploy pypi won't work, because auditwheel don't work under that os. It must be run within the
manylinux docker containers.

The following must be set to run docker in Travis CI linux
sudo: required
services: docker


Using miniconda to create different version of python in Travis CI macOS is the easiest way. Other ways are either not
working or too slow (need compile python source code).

Sometime the encrypted variables will be shown to be unset. It's likely the local travis version need to be updated.
sudo gem install travis
And then redo the encryption.
